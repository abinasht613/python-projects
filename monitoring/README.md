#Automated Log Monitoring System

Project Overview:
This project automates log file monitoring in an industry setting. It continuously reads system logs (or application logs) and detects errors, sending email alerts when critical issues occur.

1. Features:
    ✅ Monitors system/application log files in real-time.
    ✅ Detects errors, warnings, or anomalies.
    ✅ Sends email alerts for critical issues.
    ✅ Can be integrated with Slack or Telegram for instant notifications.

2. Tech Stack:
    Python (for scripting and automation)
    watchdog (for real-time file monitoring)
    smtplib (for email alerts)
    logging (for structured logging)
    argparse (for command-line arguments)
3. Implementation
    Step 1: Install Dependencies
        pip install watchdog
    Step 2: Create log_monitoring.py   
        //code

4. How It Works
    Watches application.log for updates.
    If a new line contains "ERROR", it logs the error and sends an email alert.
    Can be expanded to send alerts via Slack, Telegram, or SMS.
5. Running the Project
    Save logs in application.log:
        echo "ERROR: Database Connection Failed" >> application.log
    Run the script:
        python log_monitoring.py
6. Industry Use Cases
    ✅ Manufacturing → Detect failures in production line logs.
    ✅ Finance → Monitor logs for security breaches.
    ✅ Healthcare → Track system errors in medical devices.

7. Enhancements
    Use Elasticsearch + Kibana for real-time log visualization.
    Integrate with Slack/Telegram for instant notifications.
    Implement AI-based anomaly detection with scikit-learn.
